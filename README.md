# Marketing-analysis-of-consumer-behavior

### Soft Computing class project. 

## We will solve the problem of learning associative rules using the Apriori algorithm. This problem is common in Data Mining and we will apply it in the field of marketing in large supermarkets, where managers often need sales data to decide what products to put on a discount, how to deploy products on shelves, etc.
